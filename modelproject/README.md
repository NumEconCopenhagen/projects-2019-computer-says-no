# Modelproject

We model labour supply in a system with no tax and progressive taxation respectively, we then investigate bunching at tax cutoffs using numerical methods and illustrate the bunching phenomena. Included are superfluous functions, lots of posistional arguments, and in general untidy code, but we think the examples are well illustrated and the included text provides a nice pedagogical presentation of basic labour economics/public finance results.
