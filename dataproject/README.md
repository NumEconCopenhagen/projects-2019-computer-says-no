Subject: Wage differences for men and women, and the possible correlation with the share of women running for municipal board.

Content/method: We have gathered data for the average yearly income for men and women, in the period from 1987 - 2017 in the 98 municipalities in Denmark. We also have data for the share of women running for municipal board, in each municipality i Denmark in 2017. We want to see what the wage gap for men and women are, and how this gap differs between municipalities.  We also want to see if there is a correlation with the share of women running for municipal board, and the wage gap across the municipalities. 

DEPENDENCIES:
To reproduce the interactive map in our project, a number of packages has to be installed. This is done through the terminal (MacOS) or Anaconda terminal (Windows) by typing: conda install -c conda-forge geopandas. It will take a couple of minutes, but henceforth you are able to produce your own data maps (possibly using google alot).
